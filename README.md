Ending in a 26gb .bin file, this .zip bomb has 17 layers of recursion, each .zip file is cloned 26 times, and each contains 26 more .zip files, and so on.
Compressed, it is 406mb. I can't make any more layers, as it would be over 2gb.
When completely decompressed, it ends up being the teeny tiny size of 163.8 YOTTABYTES.
As of 2025, the estimated amount of data stored on earth is 181 zettabytes.
This zip bomb just so happens to be about 905 TIMES THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF DATA
# STORED ON EARTH!
